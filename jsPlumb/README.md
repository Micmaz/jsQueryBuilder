# jsPlumb
jsPlumb provides a means for a developer to visually connect elements on their web pages. It uses SVG or Canvas in modern browsers, and VML on IE 8 and below. The latest version is 1.6.2.

The project started out life on Google Code and was hosted there up until April 30, 2013.  From May 1st, 2013, jsPlumb lives on GitHub only.

If you're new to jsPlumb, please do take the time to read the [documentation](http://jsplumb.org/doc). 
There are a few integration issues that you should be aware of: z-index needs special attention, for example.

## Project Structure
At any time there is a built version in the `dist` directory, which contains the concatenated and minified files, as well as a full set of demos and tests, and there is a version under development in `src`.  If taking something that is working and adapting it for your needs is what you want to do, use the files in the `dist` directory.  If you need to work directly with the version in development - maybe there's a bug fix you need or whatever - you need the files in the `src` directory.

Note that the demos in the `demos` directory are always pointing at the current development version, and therefore have a long list of imports.  

## Issues
jsPlumb reluctantly uses GitHub's pedestrian issue tracker for enhancements and bugs.  But please do check the [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/jsplumb) before posting an issue, particularly if you're just asking a question.

## Requirements
- Vanilla

Vanilla jsPlumb (`dom.jsPlumb-x.x.x.js`) has no external dependencies and offers support for touch devices out of the box. 
- jQuery:

jsPlumb requires jQuery 1.3.x or later; it has been tested on 1.3.2, 1.4.x, 1.5.x, 1.6.x, 1.7.x, 1.8.x and 1.9.x. To support dragging, you will need jQueryUI 1.7.x or 1.8.x. NOTE: jQuery 1.8.x only works with jQueryUI 1.8.22 and above.

__There is a bug in jQuery 1.6.x and 1.7.x's SVG support for IE9__ - see [this issue](http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10832). It means that mouse events do not get posted. There is another discussion of the issue [here](http://forum.jquery.com/topic/1-6-2-broke-svg-hover-events).
This issue is fixed in jQuery 1.8.

- MooTools:

jsPlumb requires MooTools 1.3.x or 1.2.4 (tested on 1.3.2 and 1.2.4; it might work on other versions). To support
dragging in MooTools, you will need Drag.Move from MooTools More. jsPlumb has been tested with Drag.Move from MooTools 
More 1.3.2.1 and 1.2.4.4, but I would recommend using 1.3.2.1 as there were bugs on IE with the `getPosition()` 
function of MooTools, which the Drag.Move class uses.

__Firefox 11 and MooTools 1.3.x do not play well together in SVG mode__ - see [this issue](https://github.com/mootools/mootools-core/issues/2331)

- YUI3:

jsPlumb requires YUI 3.3.x (tested on 3.3.0; it actually might work on other versions). You do not need to 
include anything other than 'node' in your code that works with jsPlumb, but due to the asynchronous nature of 
module loading with YUI, you need to ensure you use jsPlumb's `ready` function to wrap your initialisation
code, or you cannot be sure that everything that is required is available:

    jsPlumb.ready(function() { 
      ...
    });
